January 11, 2014
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.2.1a
	
	New Features:
	1. Static Status Bars : These are status bars that are located on static pieces of geometry that are meant to display status information on an instrument panel or inside a cockpit. These objects are pre textured with their UVs pre defined. This allows for a central location for all status bars to be controlled via script.
	
	Changes:
	1. Status bar materials have been updated to allow for UV clamping in both the horizontal and vertical instead of just the horizontal. The new parameters are _ProgressH & ProgressV. The value ranges are 0-1.

September 24, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.1.9c

	New Features:
	1. The Radars screen position can now be anchored to a world object. This can be used instead of using Render To Texture to anchor the radar to a world object in order to simulate the radar being a part of a cockpit. There are limitations such as the Radars anchor position cannot be in a position that would cause the Radars camera Rect to be drawn outside the players FOV as this causes out of range errors.

September 23, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.1.9b

	Fixes:
	1. Corrected a potential issue with the TLI not staying centered on the target if the target has no velocity but the player does. 1.1.9b

	Simply apply this script to your _GameMgr object and your set.
	2. Changed the name of script FX_HUD_Selector to FX_3DRadar_Info.
	3. Moved target distance display GUI code to the demo examaple script DemoCNT.js This will open up more user customization options.

September 15, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.1.8b
	
	New Features:

	New Features:
	1. Target HUD indicators can now be selected by clicking on them. This will set the players current target to the selected object.
	2. Target HUD indicators have the option to render even if they are in the players FOV. This is another option if you do not wish to use Bounds Indicators.
	3. Radar RID targets can now be selected by clicking on their RID Tag in the radar. This will set the selected object as the players target. This does not work when using Render To Texture.
	
	These settings can be enabled in the FX_3DRadar_Mgr inspector under Radar RID / HUD Settings via Radar / HUD Indicators Mouse Selectable
	
	Changes:
	1. POIs can now be set as an active target even if outside the radar range.
	
	Fixes:
	1. If the first target to be selected had an IFF of abandoned then its color would not match the assigned color for abandoned until another target has been selected. This has been fixed.
	2. You can no longer select a target with the mouse if it is out side the radar range and not a POI
	
September 8, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.1.7b

	New Features:
	1. POI : Added the option to turn any object with a RID into a POI. This will make the objects RID Tag stick to the edges of the radar when not in radar range.
	
	Fixes:
	1. When Enable NAV In Radar is turned on and the NAV is outside the range of the radar and the player rotates then the NAV ID would be stuck and not slide around the radar edge.
	If the NAV were to move then its location would be reflected in the radar. This has been fixed and will now always reflect any object that is set to render outside on the radars edge correctly.


September 1, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.1.7a

	New Features:
	1. Assign Custom Assets : By default the Radar Manager will now detect all default assets and layers. They have to be setup and named correctly.

		b. Player Physics : Enable if you are using rigidbody.velocity to move the player.
	
	Disable these options if you are using a transform method to move your objects. You will want to use Time.smoothDeltaTime to move your objects or the TLI may look jumpy.
		
	Fixes:
	1. Fixed the target lead indicator going crazy if the players velocity was not 0.
	
	TLI calculations are based off of : http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Calculating_Lead_For_Projectiles

	!!!!! Upgrading A Project !!!!! Because of these changes you will need to Reset the script on any GameObject that currently has this script applied to it. If not you will get errors !!!!!
	
	There are other name changes but these are the only ones that will have any affect in external scripting.
	
	Fixes:
	1. When FX_3DRadar_RID has Enable Radar acive. The radar will now ignore any objects that are not detectable.
		
August 4, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.0.7

August 3, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.0.4

	Fixes:
	1. Fixed an issue for non Rift users. This would cause the players camera to cull the Default layer out. 
	This was because the new Rift support requires two HUD layers and the second HUD Lyaer 2 can only be assigned when the Rift is enabled. 
	This caused HUD Layer 2 to be set to the default layer of Default and thus prevent the rendering of any objects on the default layer. This is fixed.

August 2, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.0.4

	New Features:
	1. Oculus Rift support. (No HUD Lens Correction ATM). To enable Oculus Rift support simply click the Enable Oculus Rift in the inspector on the FX_3DRadar_Mgr. 
	Then assign the left and right cameras and create a new HUD Layer 2 and assign it to the HUD Layer 2 field.

July 31, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.0.2

	New Features:
	1. Added a separate relationship tree for the player. This will allow the player to have their own relationships with factions instead of relying on their races relationships. It is up to you how to use this ATM.
		The players relationship values can be found and changed via : FX_Faction_Mgr.PlayerRelations[n]; This is just an array with each faction mapped to the array numerically. This currently has no functionality other than it's an array. It's up to you to decide on how to use it.
	
	Fixes:
	1. Fixed an issue when first adding the FX_Faction_Mgr.js script to the _GameMgr causing errors. Thanks PhilippeDu60.

July 30, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.0.1a/b

	New Features:
	1. When displaying NAV points in the Radar and the NAVs positon is greater than the radar range. The NAV points will now stick the the edge of the radar bubble to indicate its current direction.
	
	Changes:
	1. The warning sound now has an option to play at the start if any hostile contacts are in range of the player. This also prevents the warning sound from playing when the screen is resized.

July 30, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.0.1

	Changes:
	1. Completely changed the way the player target list is generated. Old method was to use an OverlapSphere and gather all colliders in range. 
	This would then sort out the target list through the use of tags, layers, information stored in the RID scripts & Raycasting. 
	This was unnecessary and happens every time the player presses a target function key. The RID script has a built in event systems that can automatically add / remove its self’s from the player target list when necessary making the old method redundant as it required a second set of data that is already known to the RID script.
	2. Removed Target List Update. Due to the new event based target list it is no longer necessary to do timed updates to check for contacts or RID changes.
	3. Player Owned objects no longer require a tag of Player_Owned.
	
	Fixes:
	1. Blind Radar can now target a target using Blind Radar Override and is being obstructed from the player.

July 29, 2013
ForceX 3D Radar EX ver 1.0.0

	New Features
	1. New Faction Manager : This allows for the creation of up to 32 unique Factions / Races and their relationship values. This will determine which Factions / Races are Hostile / Friendly towards the Player and towards other Factions / Races.
	2. gameObjects with the FX_3DRadar_RID script have the abality to detect Hostiles targets based on Faction relationships. This list can be accessed by YourGameObject.FX_3DRadar_RID.HostileList[n]; this is a Transform list. This is not an AI it simply builds a list of Hostiles that are in radar range.
	3. Added a bounds override disable option to the FX_3DRadar_RID. Use this to prevent any given object from displaying there bounds indicators.
	4. Added a radar filter option to only display Hostile contacts. This is currently assigned to keypress "H"
	
	Changes
	1. Radar system now requires FX_Faction_Mgr.js and must be setup to function. 
	2. Player no longer requires its own layer. Instead the radar system will identify the player object by its tag "Player".
	3. Using Radar Override no longer uses its own layer. All radar contacts are now kept on the Radar Contacts layer.
	4. NAV points no longer require a tag ID of NAV.
	5. Hostile Contacts no longer require a tag ID of Hostile.
	6. Changed how a objects IFF status is set. This is now controlled by the Faction Manager script.
	7. Changed how a objects Is NAV, Is Player, Is Abandoned & Is Player Owned flags are set.
	8. Changing a objects status to Is Player Owned will automatically change its Faction to be the same as the Players Faction.
	9. Grouped option settings in the Inspector.
	10. Exposed target list settings to the inspector.
	11. Added a refresh delay to the target list. This will now only update at the interval set in the inspector instead of every frame. It is safe to set this to a high value IE 10 seconds as most events are updated as they occure. This is just incase something gets missed. 
	12. Target warning sounds will no longer play at the start.
	13. Minor tweaks that allow for more settings in the inspector to be changeable during runtime.
	14. Updated Manual & Scripting Buddy documents.
	
	Fixes:
	1. The Clear Target sound will now play when a selected target exits the player’s radar or when obstructed by an object when Blind Radar is enabled.
	2. Player owned and neutral objects will now be added to the correct target list.
